### What is Copiosa?
Copiosa is a project dedicated to making the purchase, sale or exchange of small cap cryptocurrencies seamless and 
possible for the average joe. We don't want our users to be fiddling about with transferring cryptocurrency from one
exchange to another, converting it to another blockchain setting slippage and generally having to consume a lot of 
new knowledge in order to purchase a new currency or asset. 

We are in the process of creating a mobile application & platform for users to purchase small cap cryptocurrencies on 
any network in seconds without all the trouble that if you are reading this, you have probably experienced.

### What is the purpose of the Copiosa Coin?
The purpose of the coin is to simply support the system described above. Using our own currency we can accept payments 
directly from fiat ($, £, €.. etc) and then the user can use their Copiosa balance to exchange it for any other 
cryptocurrency listed on our exchange.
